      "Question: Angelo and Melanie want to plan how many hours over the next week they should study together for their test next week. They have 2 chapters of their textbook to study and 4 worksheets to memorize. They figure out that they should dedicate 3 hours to each chapter of their textbook and 1.5 hours for each worksheet. If they plan to study no more than 4 hours each day, how many days should they plan to study total over the next week if they take a 10-minute break every hour, include 3 10-minute snack breaks each day, and 30 minutes for lunch each day?\n",
      "Let's think step by step\n",
      "Angelo and Melanie think they should dedicate 3 hours to each of the 2 chapters, 3 hours x 2 chapters = 6 hours total.\n",
      "For the worksheets they plan to dedicate 1.5 hours for each worksheet, 1.5 hours x 4 worksheets = 6 hours total.\n",
      "Angelo and Melanie need to start with planning 12 hours to study, at 4 hours a day, 12 / 4 = 3 days.\n",
      "However, they need to include time for breaks and lunch. Every hour they want to include a 10-minute break, so 12 total hours x 10 minutes = 120 extra minutes for breaks.\n",
      "They also want to include 3 10-minute snack breaks, 3 x 10 minutes = 30 minutes.\n",
      "And they want to include 30 minutes for lunch each day, so 120 minutes for breaks + 30 minutes for snack breaks + 30 minutes for lunch = 180 minutes, or 180 / 60 minutes per hour = 3 extra hours.\n",
      "So Angelo and Melanie want to plan 12 hours to study + 3 hours of breaks = 15 hours total.\n",
      "They want to study no more than 4 hours each day, 15 hours / 4 hours each day = 3.75\n",
      "They will need to plan to study 4 days to allow for all the time they need.\n",

      "Let's think step by step\n",
      "Mark's team scores 25 2 pointers, meaning they scored 25*2= 50 points in 2 pointers.\n",
      "His team also scores 6 3 pointers, meaning they scored 8*3= 24 points in 3 pointers\n",
      "They scored 10 free throws, and free throws count as one point so they scored 10*1=10 points in free throws.\n",
      "All together his team scored 50+24+10= 84 points\n",

      "Question: Angelo and Melanie want to plan how many hours over the next week they should study together for their test next week. They have 2 chapters of their textbook to study and 4 worksheets to memorize. They figure out that they should dedicate 3 hours to each chapter of their textbook and 1.5 hours for each worksheet. If they plan to study no more than 4 hours each day, how many days should they plan to study total over the next week if they take a 10-minute break every hour, include 3 10-minute snack breaks each day, and 30 minutes for lunch each day?\n",
      "Let's think step by step\n",
      "Angelo and Melanie think they should dedicate 3 hours to each of the 2 chapters, 3 hours x 2 chapters = 6 hours total.\n",
      "For the worksheets they plan to dedicate 1.5 hours for each worksheet, 1.5 hours x 4 worksheets = 6 hours total.\n",
      "Angelo and Melanie need to start with planning 12 hours to study, at 4 hours a day, 12 / 4 = 3 days.\n",
      "However, they need to include time for breaks and lunch. Every hour they want to include a 10-minute break, so 12 total hours x 10 minutes = 120 extra minutes for breaks.\n",
      "They also want to include 3 10-minute snack breaks, 3 x 10 minutes = 30 minutes.\n",
      "And they want to include 30 minutes for lunch each day, so 120 minutes for breaks + 30 minutes for snack breaks + 30 minutes for lunch = 180 minutes, or 180 / 60 minutes per hour = 3 extra hours.\n",
      "So Angelo and Melanie want to plan 12 hours to study + 3 hours of breaks = 15 hours total.\n",
      "They want to study no more than 4 hours each day, 15 hours / 4 hours each day = 3.75\n",
      "They will need to plan to study 4 days to allow for all the time they need.\n",

      "Let's think step by step\n",
      "Mark's team scores 25 2 pointers, meaning they scored 25*2= 50 points in 2 pointers.\n",
      "His team also scores 6 3 pointers, meaning they scored 8*3= 24 points in 3 pointers\n",
      "They scored 10 free throws, and free throws count as one point so they scored 10*1=10 points in free throws.\n",
      "All together his team scored 50+24+10= 84 points\n",
      "Mark's opponents scored double his team's number of 2 pointers, meaning they scored 50*2=100 points in 2 pointers.\n",
      "His opponents scored half his team's number of 3 pointers, meaning they scored 24/2= 12 points in 3 pointers.\n",
      "They also scored half Mark's team's points in free throws, meaning they scored 10/2=5 points in free throws.\n",
      "All together Mark's opponents scored 100+12+5=117 points\n",
      "The total score for the game is both team's scores added together, so it is 84+117=201 points\n",

      "Let's think step by step\n",
      "When Bella buys 2/5 times more marbles, she'll have increased the number of marbles by 2/5*60 = 24\n",
      "The total number of marbles she'll have is 60+24 = 84\n",
      "If Bella currently has 60 marbles, and she has two times as many marbles as frisbees, she has 60/2 = 30 frisbees.\n",
      "If Bella buys 2/5 times more frisbees, she'll have 2/5*30 = 12 more frisbees.\n",
      "The total number of frisbees she'll have will increase to 30+12 = 42\n",
      "Bella also has 20 more frisbees than deck cards, meaning she has 30-20 = 10 deck cards\n",

      "In total, together with bananas, the number of fruits in one basket is 24+14=38 for the first three baskets.\n",
      "Since there are three baskets each having 38 fruits, there are 3*38=114 fruits in the first three baskets.\n",

      "In the second week, Susy gains 40/2 = 20 new followers.\n",
      "In the third week, Susy gains 20/2 = 10 new followers.\n",

He rearranged five of these boxes into packages of six highlighters each and sold them for $3 per package. He sold the rest of the highlighters separately at the rate of three pens for $2. How much profit did he make in total, in dollars?\n",
      "Let's think step by step\n",
      "Sam bought 12 boxes x $10 = $120 worth of highlighters.\n",
      "He bought 12 * 30 = 360 highlighters in total.\n",
      "Sam then took 5 boxes × 6 highlighters/box = 30 highlighters.\n",
      "He sold these boxes for 5 * $3 = $15\n",
      "After selling these 5 boxes there were 360 - 30 = 330 highlighters remaining.\n",
      "These form 330 / 3 = 110 groups of three pens.\n",

What percent of the population of the school do not like to play basketball if the ratio of the male to female students is 3:2 and there are 1000 students?\n",
      "Let's think step by step\n",

      "Each part represents 1000/5 = 200 students.\n",
      "So, there are 3 x 200 = 600 males.\n",
